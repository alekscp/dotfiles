# Dotfiles
This is a collection of my dotfiles.

## To-Do
* Write script to automate setup of a new machine
** Handle all the symlinks creation
(Look into [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to do all of this)

* Always run `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace`

### After installing packages
* Setup faster key repeat (MacOS) `defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1.1`

### Packages and stuff to consider in script
* Exa
* [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/install/)
* Increse key repeat manually [For Mac](https://ksearch.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/increase-the-key-repeat-rate-in-os-x-sierra/)
